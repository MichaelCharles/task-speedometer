Task Speedometer

[See it live on GitHub pages.](https://mcaubrey.github.io/task-speedometer)

A tool for measuring how long it takes you to complete a task, and then calculates how long it will take you to complete all the tasks you need to do.

I made this to keep track of how long it takes me to grade papers.
